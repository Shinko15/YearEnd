                    Hi Love,
                    I just want to wish you a Happy New Year! ðŸŒŸ

                    First, thank you for being such an incredible part of my 2024. Iâ€™m deeply grateful for every moment weâ€™ve sharedâ€”whether it was filled with laughter, love, or even the challenges we faced together. Each one has shaped us in some way, and I wouldnâ€™t trade them for anything.
                    
                    What I hold onto the most is the joy of your smile and the happiness weâ€™ve created together. I truly hope we can create even more beautiful memories in the year ahead.
                    
                    I know this isnâ€™t the easiest thing to say, but I need to admit that Iâ€™ve made mistakesâ€”mistakes that hurt you and, in turn, hurt us. Iâ€™m sorry for being the way I was lately. Iâ€™ve told you before that if you wanted to end this, Iâ€™d let you. But the truth is, letting you go would never mean giving up on you. My love for you runs deeper than words can express, deeper than I ever imagined love could go.
                    
                    I know Iâ€™ve changed, and Iâ€™ve told you I couldnâ€™t be the same person I was before. But I didnâ€™t change because I stopped caringâ€”I changed because I wanted to grow. I wanted to be better. Iâ€™ve chosen to focus on the present, on becoming the kind of partner who can love you the way you deserve.
                    
                    I know Iâ€™m not perfect. Iâ€™ve never been. From the start, I was aware that I wasnâ€™t your ideal, that there were others you might see as better than me. I know I wasnâ€™t the candidate youâ€™d proudly introduce to your loved ones. But even with all my flaws and shortcomings, all Iâ€™ve ever wanted was to show you how much you mean to me.
                    
                    I promised to make it up to you after capstone, and now that itâ€™s done, here I am. Iâ€™m sorry it took me so long to reach this point. Iâ€™m sorry for the times I left you feeling tired and alone, for not being there when you needed me the most. Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t give you the attention, love, and support you deserved. Iâ€™m sorry for not recognizing your struggles and for failing to help you through them.
                    
                    Youâ€™ve always been my priority, even when it didnâ€™t feel that way. I regret not showing it better, not being more present, and not making you feel how much I truly care. Iâ€™ve learned from these mistakes, and I want nothing more than to make things right.
                    
                    Love, you mean everything to me. Iâ€™m here now, fully present, and ready to do whatever it takes to make things work. I love you more than words can say, and I always will.

                    And I would like to ask you out January 10, 2025 let's go around cause I would like to talk things out to you personally, but right now I'd like to give you time and space especially to myself,
                    go out with your friends and family where you find your hearts happy, do all the things you've wanted to. Take care always, I love you always. Happy New year!
